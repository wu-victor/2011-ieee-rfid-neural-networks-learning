% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
We propose a learning mechanism for tracking in a field of passive RFID tags. As mobile entities (humans or robots) equipped with RFID interrogators move through the tag field, they leave digital trails by scanning and writing to the tags. In particular, if multiple entities have a common destination and know their paths, they \emph{train} localities of tags with respect to that destination. Later on, when a user wants to move to that destination, but does not know the path, she scans localities of tags, which will point her in the right direction.

Many technologies are available for tracking and localization, including GPS and WiFi-based methods. However, these solutions often require complicated hardware and software infrastructure, and in the case of GPS, may not even work in indoor settings. Furthermore, in emergency situations, centralized infrastructure quickly fails. In our system, we propose distributing passive RFID tags in a large area. Many researchers believe that the push for pervasive computing will result in tags being affixed to everyday objects, similar to the Internet of Things \cite{2011Uckelmann}. Furthermore, radios are increasingly being integrated into personal mobile devices, including RFID, in the not-too-distant future. Finally, our system is entirely distributed, robust, and improves or degrades gracefully with changes in the tag distribution. Therefore, we believe our system is ideal for a variety of tracking scenarios. Previous research have used tag fields for tracking \cite{2006Bohn}, \cite{2010Wu}. But in our system, we use tags to dynamically learn a classification.

\section{System Description}
\label{Section: System Description}
Consider an indoor office building scenario, even though our ideas generalize to other situations. Passive RFID tags are distributed throughout the entire building, embedded in the floors, walls, and even ceilings. Suppose the desired destination is the cafeteria. Regular office workers know the cafeteria location, and are each equipped with an RFID interrogator. As a worker moves from her office to the cafeteria, her interrogator writes information to tags along the way, effectively marking a digital trail from her work location to the cafeteria. This is repeated with all workers, reinforcing the digital trails for a common destination. The tags form something not unlike a vector field over the building, with the cafeteria being the sink of the field lines. We call this an \emph{RFID vector field}. Now, if a visitor equipped with an RFID interrogator wants to find the cafeteria, she can easily follow the field lines from her given location. 

We differentiate between \emph{system trainers} who are the office workers updating RFID vector fields, and \emph{system users}, who are the building visitors using those fields. System trainers and system users may interact with the tags at the same time.

\section{Learning Algorithm}
\label{Section: Learning Algorithm}
\subsection{Overview}
Our algorithm works on small localities of tags. For example, consider a small area with $5$ tags. When a system trainer passes through this area with a desired destination, she scans the tags, and her trajectory automatically updates the $5$ tags. She essentially teaches the system, indirectly, that if a user enters the area at a particular angle, then she should exit at this particular offset angle. As more system trainers pass through the area, the tags form a classification, mapping input directions to output directions. Later on, system users visiting this locality use this classification to move toward the desired destination.
\subsection{Training}
Every possible group of $n$ tags represents a neural network, but only some of them will be of interest. Consider a system trainer passing through a group of $n$ tags, successfully scanning them at times $t_1, \ldots, t_n$, where $t_1 \le t_2 \le \ldots \le t_n$, without loss of generality. This group is ``activated" at time $t_n$, if $t_n - t_1$ is less than some threshold time, $T$. The input (for training) to the group's neural network is an $n+1$-dimensional vector, $\underline{x} = \left(1, 0, t_2-t_1, \ldots, t_n - t_1\right)$. If $n$ is large enough for a sufficiently dense tag distribution, $\underline{x}$ is very good for characterizing the incoming trajectory angle of the system trainer. Using $\underline{x}$ as the input, the neural network produces a quantized output difference angle, $\hat{\theta}$. This is compared to the real difference angle of the system trainer's trajectory, $\theta$, which is simply the difference in direction at time $t_n$, and at time $t_1$. (We assume $\theta$ can be easily calculated using an embedded magnetometer, frequently found in mobile devices.) The error $\theta - \hat\theta$ is then fed back to train the neural network. The neural network itself must be stored inline in the tags, since many system trainers are likely to train the same neural network, and they have no mechanism for communicating with each other. During the first time the neural network is trained, a unique ID that identifies the neural network and its associated RFID vector field is stored in each of the $n$ tags. The neural network weights are stored in the tags themselves. In summary, a system trainer reads the weights at activation time, performs the training algorithm, and updates the weights in the tags. (All calculations are performed by the interrogator, with resulting weights being stored back in the tags.)
\subsection{Testing}
A system user seeking a desired destination initially moves in a straight trajectory. Whenever she scans the $n$ tags belonging to a neural network within the threshold time, $T$, she reads the weights from the tags, and produces the quantized output difference angle according to the neural network. She then adjusts her trajectory by turning by that angle, and continues to move straight, until she activates the next neural network.
\subsection{Learning Equations}
We use a three-layer neural network. The input layer-to-hidden layer equations are
\begin{eqnarray}
y_j = f \left(\alpha_j\right), j \in \{1, \ldots, n_{hide}\},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha_j = \sum_{i=0}^n x_i v_{ij}$, and $v_{ij}, i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$ are the weights from the $i^{th}$ input to the $j^{th}$ hidden node. There are $n_{hide}$ hidden nodes. $v_{0j}$ are the bias weights. $f$ is the activation function, which we take to be
\begin{eqnarray}
f\left(u\right) = 1.716 \tanh \left( 2u/3\right),
\end{eqnarray}
according to \cite{2001Duda}. The hidden layer-to-output layer equations are
\begin{eqnarray}
z_k = f \left( \beta_k \right), k \in \{1, \ldots, n_{out}\}, 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta_k = \sum_{j=0}^{n_{hide}} y_j w_{jk}$, $y_0 = 1$, and $w_{jk}, j \in \{1, \ldots, n_{hide} \}$ are the weights from the $j^{th}$ hidden node to the $k^{th}$ output node. $k \in \{1, \ldots, n_{out}\}$. $w_{0k}$ are the bias weights. Each $k$ represents one of the quantized output difference angles. For example if we choose the output difference angles $\in \{0, 10, \ldots, 350\}$ degrees, then $n_{out} = 36$. The output vector is $\underline{z} = \left(z_1, \ldots, z_{n_{out}}\right)$. Now suppose the target output vector is $\underline{\tilde{z}} = \left(\tilde{z_1}, \ldots, \tilde{z}_{n_{out}}\right)$. During training, the component of $\underline{\tilde{z}}$ corresponding to the closest quantized output difference angle of the system trainer is set to $1$. All other components are set to $-1$. The mean square error is $J = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^{n_{out}} \left( \tilde{z}_k - z_k \right)$. The backpropagation algorithm adjusts the weights in a direction to reduce the error, resulting in the update equations
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{jk} := w_{jk} + \eta \left(\tilde{z}_k - z_k \right) f'\left(\beta_k\right) y_j \hspace{0.5cm} \mbox{and} \hspace{1.7cm} \\
v_{ij} := v_{ij} + 
\eta \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n_{out}} \left(\tilde{z}_k - z_k\right)f'\left(\beta_k\right)w_{jk}\right) f'\left(\alpha_j \right) x_i,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\eta$ is the learning rate, similar to \cite{2001Duda}.
\section{System Evaluation}
\label{Section: System Evaluation}
\subsection{Local and Global Performances}
We plan to evaluate our system both locally and globally. Locally, we want to know how well our neural network model maps input angles to output angles. We want to know how this depends on physical parameters, such as tag distribution and interrogation range. Globally, we want to know how our system behaves over an entire digital trail, ending at the desired destination. How does our system behave when there are multiple RFID vector fields? Will there be bottlenecks anywhere along the digital trails? How can we avoid them?

\subsection{System Robustness}
We plan to also investigate how robust our system is under a variety of influences. RFID tags are not always reliably scanned. They can even permanently fail. Our system is inherently robust since it is constantly being trained and updated. However, we seek to characterize this behavior. Furthermore, the system itself may significantly change, for example, if digital trails change. For example, consider a conference room being renovated. During that time, how will digital trails change, and how quickly? What are some strategies to address dynamically changing trails?

\subsection{Simulation and Experimentation}
We plan to use both simulation and experimentation in our evaluation. To rapidly evaluate local performance, we will first experimentally develop a statistical model of an interrogator's local scanning properties. Then we will use that model to simulate many neural networks with different parameters. These results will help us design the actual system. We will affix tags to floors and walls in a large indoor space. Then, we will move interrogators through this tag field, testing our system.

We will use the Motorola MC9090-G RFID handheld interrogator \cite{Motorola} in our experiments.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{Section: Conclusion}
We propose a learning mechanism for tracking in an RFID tag field. We motivate our proposal, provide a system description, and detail our learning algorithm. We explain our evaluation plan. Our system is entirely distributed and very robust under a variety of conditions.

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
