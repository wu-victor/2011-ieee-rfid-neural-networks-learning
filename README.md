Local Real-time Neural Networks-Based Learning for Tracking in an RFID Tag Field

http://2011.ieee-rfid.org/new-poster-session/

## Abstract

We propose a neural networks-based learning mechanism for tracking in an RFID tag field. As users move through the field to a desired destination, they train localities of tags, creating digital trails. Later on, users seeking the destination, but without knowledge of any path, can follow the digital trails. Training information (weights from the neural networks) is stored in the tags. Our system is entirely distributed and robust to failures.
